A small puzzle game made for [Ludum Dare 38](http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38).
The theme is "A Small World" and the goal of the game is to balance a small ecosystem so that all animals are happy.

The [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/) version of the game can be played [here](http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=15431bf89108875c920a1cf61e5954fd).
Currently I am working on a version implemented with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) and better graphics.
